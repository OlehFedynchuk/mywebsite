                                <p>Modern cars are cheerfully crawling in the cold, are able to disconnect the cylinders directly in motion and pleasing the minimal gaps between the body panels. They are not happy with their anonymity. Most of the machines
                                    of our time have turned into consumer goods, which we are accustomed to change as socks. A hole appeared on the shoulder - we poured out pity and put on a new pair. What can you say about modern cars after half a century,
                                    except they are hopelessly outdated? But the story of this amazing "Jaguar" in the 60's can only be said to begin. Today under the heading "Masterpieces of Goodwood by Michelin" exclusive Jaguar XK140 Michelotto.

                                <p>For most Carroll Shelby car fans, this is primarily Shelby Cobra, the Shelby Daytona Coupe, as well as the Ford Couple - the cult GT40 and modified Mustang. But there is another unknown car - Shelby LoneStar Cobra III,
                                    which will be discussed. In 1962, Carroll Shelby founded Shelby American Inc. and in 1965 the company was thinking of creating a successor to the already cult-based Cobra 427 sports car. However, it quickly turned out
                                    that all efforts were thrown to complete the racing Ford GT40 and the creation of sports versions of Ford Mustang, so that Carroll had to look for a new partner.

                        <h3>About "BUNKER"</h3>
                        <p>The history of the company began in 2017, when two students of classmates decided to do tuning cars. For these purposes, the garage under number 25 was removed. Everything started with a simple set of alarms, sound insulation and
                            auto sound. All the works were done with their own hands. Then gradually began to appear hired workers. In 2018, a corresponding LLC was registered, we left the garages and became one of the first automobile studios in Lviv,
                            which professionally engaged in tuning and additional equipment of cars. Over time, thanks to the accumulated knowledge and experience, the focus of our work has shifted from simple installations to the segment of premium-class
                            cars and integrated solutions. We began to work not only with retail clients, but also with most motor shows in Lviv. It was decided to move the "South" to the "Rick-Auto" car dealership, the only multi-branded salon in Lviv.
                            This allowed us to be closer to one of our largest customers, as well as to maximize our working conditions. Due to the large volumes of work, in early 2018 it was decided to open another box. For today we offer our clients
                            almost all kinds of tuning of the car. Having a huge experience of complex installations, we are ready to realize almost any, even the most non-standard desire of our client. Our employees are the best specialists in their
                            field in Western Ukraine, and this ensures the maximum quality of our services.
